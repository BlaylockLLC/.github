Blaylock LLC is a Midwest engineering firm focused on helping other companies create reliable products.
 Good systems, producible designs, and a strong supply chain are all needed for a business to be viable.
 Unfortunately new hires take 6-8 months to be productive, soft methods do not work for hardware management, and networks have to be developed before they can be used.
 Blaylock LLC provides engineering services related to embedded electronics including general consulting, technical research, and design development.
